                        [ Managed Code ]
• The code that runs with CLR is called managed code, whereas the
code outside the CLR is called unmanaged code.
• The CLR also provides an Interoperability layer, which allows both
the managed and unmanaged codes to interoperate.
• Any language that is written in the .NET framework is managed code.
Managed code use CLR, which looks after your applications by
managing memory, handling security, allowing cross-language
debugging, etc

                        [ Unmanaged Code ]
• The code developed outside the .NET framework is known as unmanaged
code.
• Applications that do not run under the control of the CLR are said
to be unmanaged. Certain languages such as C++ can be used to write
such applications, such as low-level access functions of the
operating system.
• Background compatibility with VB, ASP, and COM are examples of
unmanaged code. This code is executed with the help of wrapper
classes.
COM: Component Object Model: It’s a client server communication using
method in the server without the need to compile them into your
application. (old technology 1993 by Microsoft).
