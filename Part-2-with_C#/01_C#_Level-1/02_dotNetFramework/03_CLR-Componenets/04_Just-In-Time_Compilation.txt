(Ahead-Of-Time <AOT>)Compilation.               * Compiles Just the Part Of code we need            *Compiles the Used Code only
* Use (Ngen.exe) in Compilation.                     But without Caching it in memory.              *Cache the Compiled code in memory
* Compiles everythings before                   * Each Time will compile the part of code again.    *The Compiled Part will Not recompiled again.
    start execution.
*No Compilation at Run-Time.
