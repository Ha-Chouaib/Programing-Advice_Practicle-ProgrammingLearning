                                                    [ Common Type System (CTS) ]

# [CTS]--> Provides guidlines for Decalring, Using, and Managing DATA TYPES at runtime.
## It offers Cross-Language communication.
### example: VB.NET Has an Integer data type, an C# allso has its owne integer Data Type for managing integers.
    After Copilation Int32 Is Used by both Data Types.
#### So. << CTS >> Provides the data types using managed code.
     And It Helps in writing Language-Independent Code.
