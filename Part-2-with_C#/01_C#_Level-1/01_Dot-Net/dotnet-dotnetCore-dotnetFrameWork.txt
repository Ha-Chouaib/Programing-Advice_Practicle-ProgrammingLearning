==>All Of these platforms use a standard set of Libraries.
->The .NET platform includes multiple components such as :
    @ .NET runtime
    @ Based Class Library (BCL)
    @ .NET standard Library

                                                        < .NET standard Library >
                    --> is a formal spesification of the APTs that are common across .NET implementations.
                             This Allows the same code and Libraries to run at diffenrent mplemetations.
