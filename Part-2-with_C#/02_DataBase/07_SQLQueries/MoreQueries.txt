--=============================== Exists =========================
--Its a Properity we Often Use it with where statments and  it returns True  Or False Based On the Query reuslt if ther is at least a record within the result
	-- return ture No record Available rreturn false.

Select * From Customers T1 -- T1 : is Just An Aliase or nike Name for Customers
where
exists
	(
		Select * from Orders
		where CustomerID = T1.CustomerID And Amount < 600
	);

--This Method Bellow Is Faster Than Above one  Because Existe Anyways Will return ethire false or true if there is only one record so there is no need to return the whole
	-- record one is enough.
Select * From Customers T1 -- T1 : is Just An Aliase or nike Name for Customers
where
exists
	(
		Select top 1 * from Orders
		where CustomerID = T1.CustomerID And Amount < 600
	);


-- this one also is more optimized than the Query Above
-- Because there is no need to return any field so Instead Create Any Variable
Select * From Customers T1 -- T1 : is Just An Aliase or nike Name for Customers
where
exists
	(
		Select top 1 R='Y' from Orders
		where CustomerID = T1.CustomerID And Amount < 600
	);

-- The Main Gaol Of Exists is to return 1 if A Row is returned From the Query insid Or False if there is no result . Doesn't muter How many Row 


--================================== Union =========================

-- Union Combine Between result set of Tables Or Views In on Table On Condition the Tables Or Views Must Have The Same Columns
--  Also Union Returns Just Distinct Result. no Deplicated ones. but we Can Use < Union All > To Allow Deplicated ones.

use HR_Database;

select * From ActiveEmployees
Union
Select * From ResignedEmployees;

Select * From Departments
Union -- Distinct results.
Select * from Departments;

Select * From Departments
Union All --Allow deplication
Select * from Departments;

 Select ID, FirstName, LastName, GendorTitle =
	case
		When Gendor='M' Then 'Male'
		When Gendor='F' Then 'Female'

 Select ID, FirstName, LastName, GendorTitle =
