[ Constraints ]--> In Context of database are rules and conditions that are applied to the data toensure its integrity and consistency.
		=>Constraints can be a[[lieed to individual colums or to entier tables, and they are used to enforce various rulesnand restrictions on the data.
==> By Using Constraints, You can Help Ensure that your data is:
	-Accurate
	-Consistent
	-Easy to Manage

				---------------------------<<Constraintes Common Types >>------------------------------

[1]-<< Primary Key >>-> This Constraint Ensures that column or set of Columns Uniquely identifies each row in a table. and this Helps to Avoid Duplicated Rows.

[2]-<< Foreing Key >>-> This Constraint Establishes a relationship between two tables based on a key field.  This Constraint Esures that the data in One Table Much
		   the Other One In Different Related table  << Gives Referencial Integrity >>.

[3]-<< Unique Constraint >>-> This One Ensures That The data in a column or a set of columns is unique across all rows in the table. and this Constraint Helps to enforce
		            data integrity and prevent duplicate values from being inserted into the table.

					/!\ |--> Primary Key VS Uniqe Constraint <--| /!\
Primary Key: is a Unique Constraint But Not Allowing To Set Null Value While Unique Constraint Accept NULL Value.

[4]-<< NOT Null Constraint >>-> This Constraint Ensures that a column or set of Columns Cannot Contain Null Values. This Constraint Helps To Ensure That The Data
			 is Complete And Accurate, and it can help prevent errors in queries and calculations.

[5]-<< Check Constraint >>-> Ensures that the data in acolumn or a set of Columns meets a specified Condition. this Constraint Helps to Enforce data integrity 
			and prevent  invalid data from being inserted to the table.
[6]-<< Default >>-> Sets a default value for a column if no Value is specified.

[7]-<< Cearte Index >>-> Used To Create and retrieve Data from the database very quickly.
