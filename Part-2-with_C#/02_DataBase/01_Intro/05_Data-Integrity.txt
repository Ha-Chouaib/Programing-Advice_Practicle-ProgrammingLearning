[1]->( Entity Integrity ): This Ensures that each row or record in a table is unique and can be uniquely identified. this is typically achived by Primary Keys.

[2]->( Referential Integrity ): This ensures that relationships between tables are maintained and that there are no otphaned records. This is Typically achived
		 through the use of Foreing Keys. 

[3]->( Domain Integrity ): This ensures that data is within acceptable ranges or values.

- Maintaining data integrity is Critical for Orgnizations that rely on accure and trustworthy data to makedecisions.
	without data integrity, orgnizations risk making decisions based on incomplete inaccurate, or unreliable data, which can lead to poor outcomes,
	finacial losses, and damage to reputation.
-To maintain Data Integrity we use Constraints.
